Summarize the current metrics and wellness data.

**Performance Metrics**
- FTP and eFTP (current value and trend)
- VO2max (current value and trend)
- W' (anaerobic capacity)
- CTL (fitness), ATL (fatigue), form (TSB) — absolute and as %
- Rider type from `metrics.power_profile` based on `type`, `type_key`, `heuristic_score`, `type_scores`, and `type_method` (heuristic classification; explicitly mention uncertainty when scores are close)

Use this fixed rider-type output template:
`Power profile: <type> (<confidence_level>, similarity <heuristic_score>). <Short interpretation in 1-2 sentences based on p15s/p30s/p1min/p3min/p5min/p20min and curve_slope>.`

Confidence level rule:
- `high` when `heuristic_score >= 0.45`
- `moderate` when `heuristic_score >= 0.30` and `< 0.45`
- `low` when `< 0.30`

**Wellness**
- HRV: current value and trend (last 7 days)
- Resting heart rate: current value and trend
- Sleep: quality and duration (if available)
- Weight: current value and trend

**Assessment**
- What is the current form state (fresh / transition / optimal / high risk)?
- Are there any anomalies in the wellness data indicating overload or insufficient recovery?
- Recommendation: Can training load be increased next week, or is recovery the priority?

Keep the summary compact and action-oriented.
